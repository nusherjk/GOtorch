# GOtorch
A framework which can work on any computational graph and do backpropagation

it can create any linear computational graph and also can create deep neural network. it is a rather un usable in real life but my instructor of pattern recognision suggested that it is the single proof of my knowing of Backpropagation and Neural Network :)
